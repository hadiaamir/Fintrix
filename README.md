This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## HOW TO RUN THE APP

1. git clone https://github.com/hadiaamir/finchat-a1.git
2. cd into finchat-a1
3. add .env file into root. -- I sent to your emails (if on linux you might have to export ENV_VARIABLE=... for each if it doesnt work)
4. npm install
5. go to terminal and enter npm run dev
6. app running!
