Assignment 1:
Use OpenAI’s API as well as FMP’s financial data API to answer prompts like:

"Summarize Spotify's latest conference call."
"What has Airbnb management said about profitability over the last few earnings calls?"
"What are Mark Zuckerberg's and Satya Nadella's recent comments about AI?"
"How many new large deals did ServiceNow sign in the last quarter?"

Your solution should be able to handle various (random) companies and questions 
about transcript summaries as well as pulling specific financial metrics.

Your assignment should include a basic UI chat interface (preferably built with React/NextJS)
which interacts with the backend and displays the AI summaries/responses.

Please send back a public GH repo or invite our emails to a private repo so we can see the code.
Repo should include a readme with clear instructions on how to run the app locally.
